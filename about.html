            <p>My name is Brett and like most folks, I like to eat food that tastes good. I’m just slightly more interested than the average person since I’ve got a website dedicated to the topic of food. I’m the voice of the FoodTruckEmpire.com Podcast and have spent over 4-years in the restaurant business.

                I’m the guy that produces the content on FoodTruckEmpire.com and behind the Twitter and Facebook messages for the website. Producing extremely high-quality and useful content is something I’m always striving to improve for this website. If you’ve got some good content ideas or feedback, please contact me on your preferred social media website. I’m always thrilled to hear from people that have listened to the podcast, have read my content, or are into food trucks. </p>
