            <p>America exported hot dogs and burgers, now US-style food trucks are wheeling into Asia with their own modern take on traditional fast food.
                Learning from the original US mobile food vans, Asian “truckers” are offering gourmet food, at prices far below those of high-end restaurants and just a few dollars more than street vendors.
                In Japan and South Korea, there’s a food truck offering every kind of cuisine from tacos to tofu. Southeast Asian authorities are slowly cottoning onto the idea that this is how Millennials, and even their elders, want to consume their meals. </p>
