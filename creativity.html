            <p>Food trucks are one of the hottest trends in the restaurant industry, and over the last several years we’ve seen the food truck evolve from yummy hot dog carts to tasty taco wagons to all-out mouthwatering gourmet!  From ethnic fusion to cupcakes and ice cream the variety is never-ending.

                The center of food truck branding is in the design. Some trucks take food and art too another level with ridiculously cool designs that not only stand out, but tell their brand’s story. We had the pleasure of talking to 5 of some of the coolest designed Food Truck brands in the land to discuss their design and the story behind the art. </p>
