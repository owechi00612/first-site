            <p>One major secret to food truck success is the community of hungry trendhunters surrounding it. To help them connect with their “groupies”, several truck owners came up with a special app dedicated to food trucks in Germany. The app lets would-be customers know which burgers, bowls, and burritos are going to be in their area when. In California, the creators of Roaming Hunger have taken that idea one step further: Street food fans can use it not only to track down their favorite trucks, but also to find catering for their weddings, birthdays or company parties. </p>
